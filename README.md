# Paid vs. Free Apps Analysis
**Project Description**

In this data analysis project, I simulate a situation where an entrepreneur is looking to identify new areas of entry/breakthrough in the App Store. I assist the client by determining whether the application should be free or paid based on data analysis to help make an informed decision. During the course of this project I complete numerous processes including data cleaning, data analysis and data visualization. I explore a number of different metrics including analyzing user app ratings and the price range of paid apps.
